The website works as follows:
1. a judge creates a room and players join using a 5 letter code
2. upon game start, the judge gives a prompt and time limit
3. players draw their answer according the the prompt
4. when the timer is done, the judge awards which drawings get points
5. play again! and again! and again!
6. until the judge says it's the end of the game and winners are crowned
